<p><span class="dropcap"><img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="A" width="80" height="83" /></span>
<span class="largecap">A</span> very large number of people in and out of
the mechanical profession are intensely eager to
know how to become successful inventors.
Wealth, honor and glory are the reward of
the successful. Disappointment, drudgery, oblivion,
and poverty are often the portion of the less fortunate
ones.</p>

<p>Many of the latter foolishly attribute the greater
measure of success to their fellow-workers in the same
chosen field of usefulness to luck, which is far from the
truth, and to that fallacious belief they often owe their
own less favored condition. It is also an injustice to
those who have reached the summit; as there is one,
and only one road that leads to it, and which they all
have to take, and its name is "Endeavor."</p>

<p>There are numerous fictitious definitions of the successful
inventor, and yet there is but one true gauge
and test of merit that entitles one to membership in
the none-too-numerous and select fraternity. This test
is the ability of producing a commercially successful
invention.</p>

<p>That "Ability" is but the concentrated name for
the possession of numerous requirements, comprising
a vast and varied knowledge, theoretical, scientific, and
practical, not only of the various mechanical branches
necessary for successful machine designing, but of the
art and conditions for the manipulation of that product
for which a machine is designed, with or without that
machine, and the newly designed machine's economic
relation to the same.</p>

<p>Then securing the necessary co-operation of financial
means must be attended to; introducing the newly
hatched-out novelty into the market, compelling its
adoption and general use, for its purpose, and organizing
the proper fabric for its production efficiently and
economically.</p>

Last, but not least, there must be secured the possession
of a fair share of its benefits to its originator,
and to those "financial interests" necessary in the production
and marketing of a successful invention.</p>

<p>All of these accomplishments are the necessary elements
and attributes of the successful inventor, and are
the steps by which he is required to climb and mount
that desired eminence and through the skipping or
missing of any one of those steps, many aspiring climbers
have been hurled headlong to the bottom of the abyss
just as they were within reach of the goal.</p>

<p>No matter how naturally favored one may be, never
has nature so favored any individual as to bestow on
him those necessary accomplishments gratis.</p>

<p>It is one of the greatest anomalies of human nature,
that the performance of most difficult tasks, requiring
for their consummation numerous and rare attainments,
are continually undertaken by those who are least qualified
to perform them. Lured by the glittering reward
of the few successful ones, they try to gain by chance
what can only be gained by work.</p>

</div>

<p>While the elements of success in actual engineering
are general, comprised by knowledge of well-known
sciences and arts; yet the accomplishments of their
undertaking must necessarily be stamped with the individuality
of its creator, and along those lines that
repeated experiences have found necessary, to insure
success.</p>

<p>In inventing and designing a new machine, one
must first thoroughly familiarize himself with its desired
performance, as the success or failure of his
mechanical creation depends on how nearly perfect
that performance is, compared to established or
desired standards; and the performance of that machine
when made will truly denote how well its designer
understood it, and his skill in mechanical manipulation
to produce it.</p>

THAT DESIRED EMINENCE</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Another important item of calculation must be the
relative value of the probable production of the machine,
its quantity and quality, to the cost of the machine.</p>

<p>Careful consideration must be given to the working
conditions the machine will have to be adapted to.
These must include a careful study of the substance to
be worked upon in the machine, its regularity or irregularity
in shape, its constant or changing conditions
under various environments or seasons, and its general
peculiarities.</p>

<p>The cost of manipulating the machine must be
considered, that is, the required amount of power for
its propulsion, and the cost of maintaining its efficient
mechanical performance for a certain amount of production,
or its durability, and its proneness to get out
of order. Nor must one fail to take into account the
required intelligence and skill to operate it.</p>

<p>While constantly and carefully bearing in mind the
before-mentioned objective points, the prospective successful
inventor in designing his machine, must carefully
aim for cheapness of construction, which can only
be properly accomplished by designing the various
mechanical performances of the machine with the
least number of parts, and of the simplest form, requiring
for their proper production the least amount
and cheapest kind of labor in the Pattern Shop, Foundry,
and Machine Shop, and, next to the creating of
efficient and durable machines, the greatest order of
skill in a machine designer is required in producing
simple and cheap mechanical designs.</p>

<p>And yet this is not all that is required from him,
even in the mechanical line, but he must have such
mechanical movements and parts in his machine, as
will enable him to secure a good patent on it, which
will insure him protection, at the same time carefully
and absolutely avoiding any possible infringement on
others. In a measure that can be avoided by looking
up the copies of patents of similar inventions.</p>

<p>Another important factor in determining the general
design of a machine, is the probable market for
the same, as that must, in a great measure, decide the
justifiable expenditure for the initial or first general
cost, for bringing the successful machine into being.</p>

CHAPTER 3<br />
<span class="smcap medium">Financing a New Invention</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>The next important part is the financial side of it.
The estimate for this must necessarily vary with the
intended mode of disposal of the prospective invention
after its perfection.</p>

<p>If it is the intention of the inventor to dispose of
his invention after it is perfected, the expense can be
approximately estimated, and in many cases will be
moderate, of course varying with the nature of the
invention. But if it is the intention to manufacture it,
create and supply a market for it, the required capital
will always be considerable.</p>

<p>For many obvious reasons, it is considered advantageous
for the profitable exploitation of an invention
to have the financial end of it under a separate head,
which is generally the case. Usually this is "making
a virtue of necessity," as inventors seldom have anything
outside of their "aspirations and prospects,"
whether it is that "necessity is the mother of invention,"
or that "Invention is the mother of necessity,"
is something that physiologists have not quite determined.
But in any event, the prospective successful
inventor must provide himself with a "finance minister,"
variously designated as "Angel," "Backer," or
"Octopus."</p>

<p>This part of the inventive problem, to many an inventor,
is insolvable for many reasons. To solve it
successfully requires good insight, and judgment of
human nature. Ability to impart one's own "enthusiastic
aspirations," and to keep it up, requires
diplomacy and tact.</p>

<div><a name="finance_ministers" id="finance_ministers"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>FINANCE MINISTERS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But solve the problem he must if the inventor
wants to be successful, and various means have been
employed to do so. One of them, which is probably
as good as any, is for the enterprising inventor to
divide that part of his problem into two or several
parts. If he cannot command a large amount at once,
he will devote his energies to interesting successively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
small amounts, which will enable him to carry on the
development of his invention from one stage to another;
each time advancing it further, becoming stronger, and
showing enhanced prospects. To sell to each successive
"Backer" the interest of his predecessor, and if
the predecessor's money has been used to good advantage,
that can be done profitably, and to the satisfaction
of everybody concerned, as well as increasing the
available means for carrying on the exploitation of the
invention.</p>

<p>That is one of the ways by which an inventor can
provide himself steadily with some one to take care of
the "finance portfolio" in his cabinet.</p>

<p>Another, but far more hazardous way, is to resort
to the professional promoter.</p>

<p>Great care, however, must be taken by the inventor
in these various financial transactions, which necessarily
include the making and signing of various contracts
and legal instruments, that his entire invention
as well as himself are not entirely absorbed by others.</p>

<p>As competent and reliable legal advice may not
always be within his reach, he must be able to make
contracts advantageously, and above all to be the possessor
of a vision sufficiently penetrating to detect "the
nigger in the woodpile," in any paper before he signs it.</p>

CHAPTER 4<br />
<span class="smcap medium">Marketing a New Invention</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>The value and success of an invention depends
upon its demonstrated usefulness to those for whose
use it is intended, and their desire to avail themselves
of the same.</p>

<p>It very often devolves on the inventor to give that
value to it, a task which will not be found easy, especially
to the novice.</p>

<p>The first necessary steps to force an invention into
the market is to procure as many representative references
from people using his invention as possible.
This may necessitate placing his machine on trial for
a certain length of time, and personally demonstrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
its usefulness; also educating other operators to operate
his machine advantageously.</p>

<div><a name="vision_sufficiently_penetrating_to_detect_the_nigger_in_the_woodpile" id="vision_sufficiently_penetrating_to_detect_the_nigger_in_the_woodpile"></a></div>

<img class="mw" src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>VISION SUFFICIENTLY PENETRATING TO DETECT THE NIGGER IN THE WOODPILE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The inventor will find ample opportunity to display
his forebearance at this stage of the game, as he
will find at the beginning, "no one poor enough to do
his invention reverence." And it is one of the strange
things that one observes in life, that many people who
have not sufficient energy and intelligence to raise
themselves beyond the very humblest and meanest
occupations in life, consider themselves amply qualified
to criticise, and even make suggestions on inventions
that some of the best brains have spent their
best on.</p>

<p>But this is a condition that must be reckoned with
and overcome in introducing a new machine on the
market, and the inventor will find it to his advantage
to use every possible means to persuade and win over
those who will have to operate his machine, as well as
to demonstrate to the proprietor himself the usefulness
of the invention; and sometimes even he may find it
to his advantage to furnish an educated operator for
the machine.</p>

<p>If his means are limited, which is often the case,
he will have to act as his own salesman, advertisement-writer,
and press-agent until the invention becomes
firmly established in the market. To go out in the
cold, wide world and solicit orders even on approval
for a new invention requires considerable adaptability,
pluck, patience, and hard work. Very often success or
failure depends upon the initial exertions in that direction.</p>

<p>No fixed rules can be laid down for that kind of
work. To be successful, it must be varied with the
nature and the disposition of every individual who
does the selling and buying. But generally speaking,
it is a safe rule for a salesman to observe, "Brevity,
Directness, Simplicity, and Politeness," as the average
business man is, by force of circumstances, homeopathic.
They like "Talks" in small quantities, concentrated
form, and sugar-coated.</p>

<p>Sometimes silence, the ability to keep one's mouth
closed, and to respectfully listen to a loquacious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
prospective buyer, will secure an order for a machine,
where a disposition to do all the talking, however "silvery"
will not accomplish the same "golden" results.</p>

<p>Another important factor in introducing a machine
into the market is advertising by mail.</p>

<p>Painstaking exertions coupled with the required
ability to get up a proper circular, which should include
a clear cut, half-tone preferably, of the machine to be
sold, a concise explicit statement of the nature of the
machine, and its capacity, and its advantages over previous
or other methods of doing the same work.</p>

<p>In wording and phrasing your circular, observe
simplicity. A list of references will materially enhance
your chances of securing attention, as most people are
willing to say "Me Too," where you could never get
them to say "I."</p>

<p>In the general get-up of your circular it is best to
have such an arrangement as will readily go into an
ordinary business envelope, without folding. If, however,
it must be folded, it must be so arranged that the
fold so creased will not come at a vital point. Plain,
clear type of convenient size, on good white paper, and
black ink, is better than rainbow colors. However, a
different color for a few words now and then for emphasis,
is permissible, and may help to bring out certain
points which you wish the prospective buyer's
attention called to.</p>

<p>The general get-up of the circular must be of such
a nature and form, that the prospective buyer of
average intelligence will be attracted by it, and will get
a general idea of what it has to tell him at a glance.</p>

<p>It is even best to leave the price of the article off
the circular, as that will induce people to inquire for
it, and give one a chance to get in touch with those who
are interested, while those who would not even inquire
for the price, would not buy any way.</p>

<p>Another means for introducing a new invention on
the market, is in "write-ups" of the same in the daily
papers, magazines, and trade papers; as very unfortunately
a good many people would not pay any attention
to circulars, and would not find time to grant a
personal interview to a solicitor, yet they do look up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
printed matter in the form of a newspaper, magazine,
or trade-paper, and very often get their own views on
any subject from the general tone of the article they
read.</p>

<p>These articles require considerable intelligence,
care, and literary ability to prepare, and more to get
them printed, as they naturally have to vary in tone
and style with the paper, or magazine they are printed
in.</p>

<p>It is more or less easy to get a write-up in a trades-paper
for an article that comes within its sphere, and
very often the editor of that magazine will be willing
to do the writing-up, from circulars furnished to him
or from observations of the machines as a news item,
for the dual purpose of furnishing its readers with useful
information, and of obtaining advertising patronage
from the beneficiary.</p>

<p>In other magazines, it will require more ingenuity
and literary merit to get in at all, and except in very
rare instances, it would be best for the inventor to turn
that part of the business over to some one who has
experience in that line of work, and knows "how."</p>

CHAPTER 5<br />
<span class="smcap medium">Determining the Selling Price of a Newly
Invented Article</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>Considerable business acumen is required in determining
and fixing the selling price of a new machine.</p>

<p>The factors to be taken into consideration are, the
value of its saving in every direction to its purchaser,
the average amount of capital invested in the prospective
purchaser's business, and the amount to be
invested in the machine, as very often a machine may
be beyond the reach of those for whose use it is desired,
by reason of its price.</p>

<p>In any event, the cost of producing the machine
should not be a factor in determining the price, but the
value of its product. And the cost of producing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
same results by any other process, will give a very fair
estimate, after taking into consideration the means of
the people who have to buy it.</p>

<p>Generally a machine is sold outright to the consumer,
but in some instances they are only rented for
certain periods or volumes of production.</p>

<p>That has to be determined by the nature of the
invention and the business to which it applies.</p>

CHAPTER 6<br />
<span class="smcap medium">Office Management and Business Policies</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>If the inventor is unfortunate enough to be compelled
to attend to his own office work, he will probably
find it advantageous to observe the following rules:</p>

<p>Answer all letters promptly, briefly, and politely,
and don't write what you feel like, as that will often
get you into trouble. Don't forget to make a copy,
and keep it, of every letter you send out, and file carefully
all letters you receive.</p>

<p>If the inventor has to be his own purchasing agent,
he should remember that the lowest price is not always
the cheapest, and the highest price doesn't indicate
that you couldn't get it any cheaper elsewhere, and as
good, if not better.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, arrange for everything to be
delivered at your place, as that throws the transit responsibility
on the contractor until the goods are delivered,
and your credit is also longer.</p>

<p>Order your goods as much ahead of time as possible
as goods are very rarely delivered on the time they are
promised.</p>

<p>Examine all goods delivered in your place as to
quality and weight, and keep a careful memorandum
of the same, and don't forget to check off the bills you
receive for the same.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to complain of unfair treatment,
even at the risk of being called a "kicker."</p>

<p>Remember that the faithful performance of your
duties for the firm that trusts and depends upon you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
is more important than the catering to anybody, especially
if it has to be done at the expense of the firm
you represent.</p>

<p>Don't expect "perfection" from people you are
dealing with, as they have also a good many things to
contend with, and when once you have O. K.'d the
bills, pay for them as soon as possible if you want to
maintain your credit and your self-respect.</p>

<p>Honesty and straight dealings will materially increase
your chances of staying in the market, once you
get there.</p>

<p>Cultivating a good name with the people you are
dealing with, is better than "kowtowing" to "Rating
Agencies," as well as being the cheapest and very best
kind of advertising. Never misrepresent your financial
condition when furnishing a statement to your bank,
for you may do it once too often, and then you will
wish "you hadn't." You will travel more easily and
further by telling the truth.</p>

CHAPTER 7<br />
<span class="smcap">Divers Ways of Exploiting an Invention</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>Having advanced his invention to the stage of having
obtained a footing in the market, the inventor has
reached the "Parting of the Ways," and now is the
time for him to decide whether he is to sell his invention,
or to keep it.</p>

<p>If he decides to sell, his likely buyers are those who
are in that line of business, and who are generally willing
to add to their established business some patented
novelty in their own line, that will give them exclusive
use, and special advertising facilities, thereby increasing
their profits, and enhancing their prestige; or some
capitalist on the alert for a profitable investment, and
congenial occupation.</p>

<p>The decision of the inventor must depend upon the
nature of the invention, its profitableness, his own
financial resources, his health, his energies, temperament,
and the likelihood of his invention being imitated,
and his mechanical and financial ability to protect
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Generally speaking the proverb about "A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush," is very applicable
to inventions, and the inventor who is blessed with a
grain of prudence in his make-up, will think carefully,
and his best, before he refuses a fair offer.</p>

<p>If he desires to sell, a sum of money outright is
better than a royalty.</p>

<p>Should it not be practical or desirable to dispose
of it, he must make preparations to supply the market
in constantly increased proportions.</p>

<p>Owing to the various kinds of skilled labor, numerous
expensive tools, machinery, high rents for suitable
manufacturing places necessary for the building of
machinery, requiring the investment of large capital,
and the devotion of a great deal of time for organization
and supervision, many inventors find it convenient,
even profitable, to have their machines built under
contract by some established manufacturing concern
which is properly equipped for that special kind of
work. This in many cases is a very wise business-like
course to pursue, as it eliminates the necessity of a
large investment, and leaves the inventor free to devote
himself to improving and enlarging the field for his
invention, and to attend to the business end to better
advantage.</p>

</div>

<p>Should it, however, be decided to manufacture his
invention, it will be found that a proper system for
regular routine will be required to produce the articles
within reasonable cost.</p>

<p>If the inventor has no special experience in manufacturing,
it will be greatly to his advantage to procure
information, by inspection, and carefully noting the
methods employed in up-to-date manufacturing establishments,
making similar articles.</p>

<p>Manufacturing must be carried out from "THE
TOP DOWNWARDS," not from "THE BOTTOM
UPWARDS." That is, the brain work in the office
must be carefully planned and carried out first, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
recorded in assembly and detail drawings and carefully
written-up specifications.</p>

<p>Next a double set of metal patterns should be made
to be kept in two separate places to guard against fire.</p>

<p>To do everything should not be attempted in the
beginning, as many parts requiring special equipment
and special skill, such as foundry work, drop forging,
gear making, and wood work, can very often be contracted
for with persons especially equipped to do that
work, at less than the price it would cost to produce
them by a firm which has to do a little of everything.
Elimination of that much of the work permits better
concentration and increased facilities for the other
work, resulting in a maximum of production with a
minimum of investment.</p>

<p>The work in the factory should be carefully divided
up, and localized.</p>

<p>If the quantities of complete manufactured articles
to be made are large, or there is a fair prospect that
they will be so, and their sale is not localized, a duplicate,
interchangeable system of manufacture is indispensable,
and should be employed from the very beginning.
In spite of the initial expenses for tools, it
will be found to be a great saver of worry, annoyance,
trouble, and money. Also the labor cost for duplicate
parts in the making and assembling is very considerably
less than if made in the "GOOD OLD WAY."
This makes it possible to supply parts that will fit the
machine which will be required in the course of usage,
in any part of the world where it may happen to be,
and which often forms a considerable part of the
profits. Indeed it may be truly said that it sometimes
pays to give machines away for nothing, if assured a
monopoly of its repairs at one's own prices.</p>

<p>The "gang-boss" system in the shop will be found
a material aid in producing and maintaining a desired
standard of quality and quantity. It will also lessen
the necessary supervision and worry in tracing, and
eliminate deficient and jarring elements in production.</p>

by the management, of the merits of their employees,
will be duly rewarded by the willing and faithful
co-operation of those on whom in a great measure
the success or failure of manufacturing depends; also
enhancing the value of the profits by the addition of
the goodwill, and wellwishes of those who help to
create it, as the want of it often mars the enjoyment of
the money when earned.</p>

<span class="smcap medium">Warning to Prospective Inventors</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>By a careful perusal of what has been said, it will
be seen that the undertaking of a successful invention
is no easy task, and that it cannot fall to one's lot by
mere chance.</p>

<p>It is quite true that, like the diamond, the inventor,
the general, orator, or writer is born. But be it also
remembered that even a diamond has to be cut, ground,
and polished before it attains its lustre, and the inventor
or general, writer and orator are no exceptions to the
rule.</p>

<p>The general could not conquer a valiant foe if he
did not master the science of war, or if he failed to
familiarize himself with most of the conspicuous experiences
of others in the same profession.</p>

<p>The writer and orator would have no audience if
they failed to fertilize their brains with rich stores of
knowledge to draw upon, and with proper means of
expressing themselves.</p>

<p>And the inventor is generally doomed to failure if
he fails to earnestly apply himself to the acquisition
and mastery of that knowledge which is potent to successful
invention in the mechanical line, and to get his
just or fair share of its value.</p>

successful inventors. Foolishly do they imagine it a
short and easy cut to opulence and ease. Enthused
with their delusion, they become unfitted for their
usual occupations, and are encouraged to persevere in
their fallacies by the slick, cunning sharks whose inevitable
prey they become through it. These not only
take their very last dollar, but very often the substance
of those depending upon them; until at last, poor,
ruined, deluded fools, they wake up to the realization
of the grand truth, "THAT ONE GETS NOTHING
FOR NOTHING," not even experience. But it is
none the less unfortunately true, that those very victims
themselves are responsible for the existence of the
means and conditions for their undoing. If perchance
in the outset of their ruinous career, they encounter
one who would give them competent and honest advice,
if it be at variance with their own ill-conceived notions
and pride, he will receive insults for his pains, and be
deprived of the opportunity of rendering any services
to the profession of which his ability and integrity
makes him a creditable and honorable member.</p>

CHAPTER 10<br />
<span class="smcap medium">Advice to Inventors on Inventions</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>What and how to invent, is very often asked and
variously answered. On the nature of the answer to
the honest inquirer often depends whether he is to be
discouraged in a good undertaking, or sent on a fool's
errand, or directed rightly to the avenue of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
The various answers to what and how to invent may
be divided into three different kinds. The stupid, the
misleading, and the intelligent. The remark is often
made by certain people, "Oh, there used to be lots of
chances to make fortunes out of inventions YEARS
AGO, but not NOW." This is as stupid as it is untrue.</p>

<p>Never in the history of the world, have the opportunities
been as numerous and the rewards as great as
they are now for any and every kind of meritorious
invention. Our advanced civilization, the complex
intricacies of our social fabric, the enormous general
increase in wealth and the consequent general ability,
to greater or less extent, to gratify our numerous and
various desires, has created an unlimited field of opportunity
for the ingenious, fertile and enterprising
brain. Not only for the improvements upon methods
of "doing things," for which there is no man capable
of setting a limit, but even for the invention and creation
of entirely new means of gratification and utility.</p>

<p>The inventor of steam locomotion created for mankind
a new means of providing for certain phases of
its existence. Yet THOSE who successively contributed
their ingenuity and made the MODERN locomotive
possible have filled a want, served a useful purpose,
conferred a benefit and justly earned and merited
reward. The existence of the perfected steam locomotive
did not deter human ingenuity and enterprise
from developing electric traction. The inventors of
wireless telegraphy, were not deterred or discouraged
in their efforts by the existence of telegraph wires.
The fact that, in all the unknown thousands of years of
human existence, speech was considered only a human
prerogative did not prevent "THE SAGE OF LLEWELLYN"
from giving to the world the phonograph.</p>

<p>Every human brain is different from every other;
endowed with its own special marvellous capacity,
making it possible for it to succeed in new directions.</p>

<p>Who can fathom, or set a limit to the ingenuity of
that divine creation, THE HUMAN BRAIN? None
but its Creator. Our ordinary every-day mechanical
utilities would be considered MAGIC by him who
wrote, "There is nothing new under the Sun."</p>

Happily the world is not apt to suffer from the
foolish slogan of "IN GOOD OLD TIMES," as generally
the possessor of extraordinary abilities will not
be deterred by it from using them. And a SIGH for
PAST opportunities is but a true indication of the
unfitness of its unfortunate emitter for any opportunity.</p>

<p>The "MISLEADING ANSWER" to "WHAT
AND HOW TO INVENT" is that which tells everybody
and anybody, to invent ANYTHING AND
EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>Human abilities and environments vary, and it
necessarily follows that every individual cannot be successful
in that undertaking which requires for its successful
accomplishment that which manifestly his
Creator did not endow him with. Nor is the capable
man apt to be as successful in a direction where,
through his environments, he is a stranger, as he would
in that field of operation that he has been most active
in. It is better and cheaper for a person to first determine
his possession of the abilities for doing certain
things, than to find out the want of them by the failure
of his undertaking. The gifted individual will also find
success easier to attain if his efforts are directed in
experienced channels, than if prospecting on what is
to him, "unexplored wilds."</p>

<p>And to the "MISLEADING ANSWER" OF
"WHAT AND HOW TO INVENT," can be, in a great
measure, attributed the product of the inventive
weeds that choke up the patent offices as well as the
elimination of numerous individuals from ordinary
but useful occupations for which their Creator evidently
intended them. Their wasted substances furnishes a
fat living to them who make a profession to give out
this "misleading" advice broadcast.</p>

CHAPTER 11<br />
<span class="smcap medium">General Definition and Classification of
Inventions</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>To "ANSWER INTELLIGENTLY WHAT AND
HOW TO INVENT." It is first necessary to analyze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
most carefully the various phases of invention of various
natures.</p>

<p>It will be observed that inventions in general may
be divided into several divisions, as follows:</p>

<p>First:&mdash;Fundamental physical principles, which are
very rare and purely scientific.</p>

<p>Second:&mdash;Basic mechanical adaptation to and for
the first division which generally comes into existence
soon after the discovery of the first.</p>

<p>Third:&mdash;Basic mechanical adaptation to a well-defined
production, substituting human or animal exertions;
which comes by degrees, and none too often.</p>

<p>Fourth:&mdash;Improved mechanical applications.</p>

<p>Fifth:&mdash;Diverse or varied mechanical applications.</p>

<p>The last two are the most prolific or numerous
classes. The first division includes our physical
sciences. The second is the first mechanical harness
for utilizing a new discovery in the laws of physics for
different purposes. The third includes the first mechanical
appliances receiving impulse from some other
body for doing to greater advantage that which is done
by direct human or animal exertions, and are commonly
termed labor-saving machines.</p>

<p>The fourth are the continuous improvements on
the third, and may include basic mechanical contrivances.</p>

<p>The fifth is for accomplishing the same ends as the
Second, Third and Fourth, but also for the greater
adaptability for certain specific purposes, and for popularizing
its production; that is to prevent the exclusive
monopolizing of certain advantages gained through
and by the Second and Third.</p>

<p>One cannot possibly fail to get enthusiastic over
the achievements of the long line of great scientific
minds, who have made our civilization possible. "When
will their glory fade?"</p>

<p>More humble, yet as useful, are the numerous
inventors whose achievements necessarily come under
the Third, Fourth and Fifth classification. The inventing
and designing of a machine to do work more

increases and cheapens a useful production, placing
it within reach of those who would otherwise be deprived

CHAPTER 13<br />
<span class="smcap medium">How to Invent</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>How to invent? Invention is a problem and a
solution. It necessarily follows that the first thing to
do is to thoroughly comprehend the problem and then
contrive mechanical means to solve it. Work from
the centre outwardly; that is, build up your machine
around your object of accomplishment. Do not try
to design a machine and insert it afterwards.</p>

<p>There are many men so extraordinarily gifted that
it is possible for them to succeed in diverse directions,
even in those for which they have not been especially
equipped by training. That is conspicuously true in
invention.</p>

<p>Useful inventions have been invented, and fortunes
made by the inventors who were not engineers so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
as training was concerned, nor were they even machinists,
yet their extraordinary gifts have out-balanced
the disadvantage of the lack of training for mechanical
creation; but they all had to enlist, more or less, the
services of others to make up for their own deficiencies.
No doubt there will be many more inventors from
outside the ranks of mechanical engineers, and they
will find the following suggestions useful.</p>

<p>Understand thoroughly what you have to accomplish,
first of all. After conceiving your ideas of a
mechanical contrivance to do it with, try and make
some kind of a sketch of the whole and the part
respectively.</p>

<div class="header">

CHAPTER 14<br />
<span class="smcap medium">How to Make Sketches and Specifications</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>The fact that you are not a draftsman or have
even no idea of how drawings are made, need not
deter you from making sketches that will be understood.
A sketch or drawing is a representation more or less
correct of the imaginary object in your brain. Drawings
or sketches are the easiest kind of writing. They
are picture writing, usually the first mode of writing
employed by primitive people, and any man who has
the intelligence to invent, no doubt has sufficient
ability to make some kind of sketches with pencil on
paper of the pictures he conceives in his brain.</p>

<p>In making your sketch, remember that nearly
every object has many sides to it, and your sketch is to
impart a conception of the shape and form of that
object to somebody else who has no knowledge of it,
and must necessarily get his ideas from your sketches
as he cannot look inside of your brain; therefore make
as many sketches of your object as there are sides to
it, and mark them, front, side, back, top and bottom,
and every separate piece, 1, 2, 3, etc.</p>

<p>Write up explanations or specifications of the same.
You can learn how to do that by reading standard
works on applied mechanics.</p>

CHAPTER 15<br />
<span class="smcap medium">The Necessity of Competent Engineering for
Successful Invention</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>Having done that much, now do not make a "bee
line" for the Patent Office. Do not imagine that the
goal of your ambition, or the end of your tribulations
lies in the Patent Office, that the obtaining of some
kind of a patent places an "Aladdin's Lamp" at your
disposal. You have not got anything positive as yet to
get a patent on&mdash;the fact is you only think you have
something&mdash;but your judgment may not be the very
best on the subject for your own good. Take your
sketches and your specifications and consult a competent,
reputable engineer, and he will tell you what
are the prospects and probabilities of your invention.
If your invention is a valuable one, engage his services
to re-design it for you, and to make it practical. Don't
think that because you are an inventor you are necessarily
a "natural born engineer." They don't grow
that way. But be wise enough "to know what you
don't know," and to get the right services from the
right man. After your engineer has incorporated your
invented idea in a suitable body, try to get your
protection in the Patent Office on the form in which
you intend utilizing your idea. No patents are granted
on ideas.</p>

<p>You will find the money spent on engineering your
invention well spent, as very often large sums of money
would be saved in making models and experimenting,
and litigation would often be avoided if the inventor
would have the practical "horse sense" to go to a competent
engineer when in need of engineering skill.</p>

<p>In designing and inventing a machine for doing
certain work on a certain article which is otherwise
done by hand, it does not necessarily follow that the
machine must imitate in its actions the method employed
by hand in accomplishing the same ends. That
is very often not the only or the best method of doing
it. While it is desirable for the machine to accomplish
as good, or better, results than is accomplished by hand
process, it may be far from desirable for the machine to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
imitate in its action the HAND PROCESS in doing it.
That may be a very roundabout way of doing it, and
may not lend itself to simple and desirable mechanical
manipulation. For that reason the inventor of a labor-saving
machine may often have to first invent a new
process for bringing about certain results on the substances
on which his machine is to operate, that may
be radically different from the method employed by
hand.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>AN INTELLIGENT AND PRUDENT INVENTOR WILL CAREFULLY NOTE HIS OWN CAPACITY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is therefore obvious that, to invent a labor-saving
machine successfully, it is first necessary to determine
the executive method of operation, and often to invent
a more suitable and adaptable one before inventing
the means for accomplishing the same, as the executive
part of his contemplated machine is his problem, and
the ease or difficulty of its solution depends upon its
simplicity. The intelligent and prudent inventor will
carefully note his own special capacity, aptitude, taste,
education, training, experience, and opportunity in
certain directions. He will carefully weigh and measure
so far as possible in advance his proposed undertaking,
and when finally decided upon, he will set
himself to work enthusiastically on the lines laid down
in this article, and with all the devotion and tenacity
that is in him, knowing no defeat, learning and finding
new means to solve the problem from every set-back
and apparent failure, until he will bring it to a successful
accomplishment, and actually tear Victory from
the Jaws of Defeat.</p>

<span class="smcap medium">Pert Pointers for Prospective Inventors That
Will Be Found Helpful</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>While it is impossible to lay down fixed rules for
the would-be successful inventor to follow, the following
will be found useful:</p>

<p>Observe everything carefully. Try to remember
everything you see. Acquire the habit of concentration.
Reason logically. Do not overlook details. Be a hard
worker. Keep your mouth shut. Don't count your
chickens before they are hatched. Don't get inflated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
with your superiority, neglecting to avail yourself of
the accumulated knowledge and experience of others.
Don't imagine yourself a Solomon. Don't bite off
more than you can swallow. (Read Æsop's fable
about the "Eagle and the Jackdaw.") Don't set
yourself a Quixotic task, and, on the other hand, don't
think it is impossible for you to succeed where others
have failed.</p>

<div><a name="observe_everything_carefully_try_to_remember_everything_you_see_reason_logically_do_not_overlook_details" id="observe_everything_carefully_try_to_remember_everything_you_see_reason_logically_do_not_overlook_details"></a></div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>OBSERVE EVERYTHING CAREFULLY. TRY TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING YOU SEE. REASON
LOGICALLY. DO NOT OVERLOOK DETAILS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Do not start an advance account in greatness by
telling everybody you come in contact with what a
wonderful invention you are working on, thereby trying
to enhance your importance with them. Remember
you are not "It" until you have succeeded, and
when you do, the world will know it soon enough, and
you will not suffer by reason of its having found it out
for itself. Remember an inventor is only judged by
what he has made good, not by what he has attempted.</p>

<p>Don't, oh! please don't go about with a face as
solemn and anxious as if you were an Atlas. Using
the inside of your head, should not be sufficient reason
for neglecting the outside of it by "boycotting" the
barber. Hair is not "Wisdom teeth."</p>

<p>Do not waste your time complaining for the want
of appreciation in your wife, for the "great ideas" you
have in your head. She may have a strain of Missourian
blood in her veins, and "She wants to be
shown." When you "do," you can be sure she will
not be slow in handing you up the "sugar lumps."</p>

<p>Because Shakespeare, Napoleon, Ruskin, etc.,
have parted from the partners of their youth, should not
lead you to the deduction that it necessarily is the earmarks
of greatness to cast aside, when you have become
successful, the sharer of your early poverty and struggles.
You will be greater by not following anybody's example,
in that respect.</p>

</div>

<p>The protection of an invention implies the dual
problem of how to prevent others from stealing the
product of one's mental labor, and of how to insure a
fair share of its value to the inventor.</p>

<p>To solve that problem absolutely is of course no
more possible than the absolute prevention of the pilfering
of anything else of value in the world, but it may
be made as secure as the present circumstances in the
case will permit if the inventor, to use a slang expression,
will be "on to the game." To be that, he first has to
know with whom he has to reckon, and how the stealing
is done, and the best way to checkmate it.</p>

<span class="smcap medium">Various Ways Employed to Cheat and Rob
Inventors</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>While it is impossible to enumerate all of the different
methods employed in bringing about the proverbial
slip between the cup and the inventor's lip, a
few of the usual means, and those generally adopted,
in fact so general, that they have come to be looked
upon as almost legitimate, established precedents, are
as follows:</p>

<p>If the inventor is in the employ of a company manufacturing
goods, to which his invention is a valuable
addition, the company simply "takes it," and applies
for a patent on the same, as being the original inventor.
In most cases the inventor is not even informed of the
patent application, and generally some high official in
the company's employ claims and gets the credit and
reward for inventing it. Should that invention be very
valuable, or the inventor commits the indiscretion of
making other inventions, he will be promptly discharged
on one pretense or another, to be rid of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
presence, so as to "nip any possible trouble in the
bud," and the poor inventor has to "drift" for a while
until he strikes something again and probably has a
similar experience in the course of time, if he did not
get "wise" by his last experience.</p>

<p>Another pet practice is for a concern to boldly
take another man's invention that is valuable to it,
and work it as if it were its own, of course making
money out of it, and very often doing so undisturbed.
This may be possible for a variety of reasons, such as,
being at a distance from the inventor and his having
no means of finding it out; or, again, he may be dead,
and his rightful heirs may have no knowledge of the
patent, its value or its infringement. But should even
the inventor be alive and find them out and attempt to
call them to account, he will promptly be informed to
"go and see their lawyers," which is only another way
of telling him, "well, what are you going to do about
it?" For if he goes to see their lawyers, they will
most condescendingly and patronizingly inform him
that that patent is not "valid," and advise him not to
bother his head about it, as it would do him no good.
And unless he has the means to engage lawyers, who
require fat "retainers," he is absolutely helpless, and
the exploiters of his invention can enjoy their ill-gotten
gains with impunity.</p>

<p>Incredible, yet it is true, that if a patent is infringed
upon, and for some reason the inventor, though cognizant
of it, does not commence suit, it is held that he
acquiesced in the same, and the parties who are stealing
his invention, as well as others, can go on robbing
him with impunity.</p>

<p>The "INTERFERENCE" trick is usually resorted
to, to transfer a valuable invention from a poor but
rightful owner to those who want it, and have the
money to make profitable use of it and pay for the
trick. The most surprising part of it is that it is done

<p>THE EXPLOITERS OF HIS INVENTION CAN ENJOY THEIR ILL-GOTTEN GAINS WITH IMPUNITY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A manufacturer of a certain line of goods makes
it his business promptly to obtain copies of all patents
in his own line of goods as soon as they are issued.
When he finds something that he thinks he wants or
can use to advantage in his business, he promptly goes
ahead, starts to make it by copying the patent illustration
in the published records, and as promptly and
innocently files a patent application in the patent office,
which is an exact duplicate and copy of the other man's
patent that has been issued and published.</p>

<p>In due course he gets the return of his patent application
from the patent office with the citation against
it of the other man's patent that he is copying. He
then promptly notes the date of the patent application
of the other man's patent and files what is called in the
patent office as "INTERFERENCE," simply claiming
that he invented his invention or thought about it,
or dreamed about it at a previous time, allowing himself
a sufficient margin of a year or two before the date
of application of the other man's patent, and thereby
claiming himself the rightful inventor of the same,
boosting up his own false affidavit by one or two lying
witnesses, which experience has demonstrated is a commercial
commodity. Having done that, it is necessary
for the right inventor, who has received due notice from
the Patent Office, to come and defend his title to his
patent, in spite of the fact that the patent has been
issued to him after the customary and usual formalities
in due legal form, and payment of all legal fees. In
order to defend the same now, he is obliged to engage
attorneys who require the usual and indispensable retainers,
fees, etc., without any certainty at all of being
able to retain his just claim to his patent, for the very
simple reason that the time of the filing of his patent
was probably within a reasonable time of the making
of his invention, and he has to combat the sworn testimony
of his adversaries, who have given themselves
ample latitude in insuring their priority claim. While
they are swearing falsely, they reason, and rightly so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
that it is no more criminal to lie by the year than by
the month, and consequently they make sure of it, and
give themselves plenty of rope, with the result that the
rightful inventor, after paying his original fees for the
obtaining of the patents and the second fees for defending
it, usually loses the same and his invention,
simply because circumstances and his conscience do
not permit him to defend himself against his adversaries
with the same weapons he is attacked with,
namely, perjury; thus he remains by force of circumstances
an honest man considerably poorer, and a
whole lot wiser by his experience.</p>

<p>Another method in vogue for appropriating other
people's inventions, is to copy it, making some slight
minor change in it, and defend it in court, if need be,
on technicalities.</p>

<p>There are still other ways, by which inventors often
lose their just dues, which is generally the fault of their
own inexperience, as for instance, by giving exclusive
manufacturing privileges to somebody without a reasonable
guarantee, for the making of a certain quantity
per stipulated period. The possessor of the privilege
will then only have to make one in the whole life of the
contract, and thereby rid himself of a competitive
article from the market, at the inventor's expense.</p>

<p>Then there are various methods of avoiding the payment
of royalties on all that's made, by getting them
made at different places, unknown to the inventor, and
by keeping two sets of books. If the invention forms
the basis of a Stock Company, by allowing the inventor
only a minority of the stock, and taking all of the earnings
of the invention in large salaries by the controlling
parties, thus leaving the inventor out in the cold.</p>

<span class="smcap medium">The Root of the Evil</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>The different ways of appropriating other people's
invention without giving any equivalent for it, are made
possible by our existing laws which are notoriously defective
for insuring justice and equity to those who labor
with their brains, who, in the opinion of most people,
are as deserving of protection, in the enjoyment of the
fruits of their labor, as they who work with their hands.</p>

<p>If the man who cultivates the soil, raises a crop and
when the same is ripe, some one should come and boldly
reap and harvest the same, and carry it off to his barn
and enjoy the proceeds thereof, the law would immediately
lay its hands on that person, deprive him of his
stolen goods, to return the same to the rightful owner.
The community would also be wrought up in righteous
indignation and add its ostracism of the malefactor,
even after he has been deprived of his stealings, suffered
the penalty, and is probably penitent.</p>

<p>But it is different, oh! how different, if the stolen
property is a mental instead of a hand product. It
ought to be apparent that there is a defect somewhere
in the profound reasoning of our august law-makers
and honorable jurists in framing and interpreting our
laws for protection of property that makes it possible
for a man to arrest another man that he has found in
possession of his plow, while allowing a man to steal
another man's invention, for the improvement of all
plows, and to throw the inventor out of his office for
attempting to remonstrate with him for appropriating
his property.</p>

<p>The law is very partial in protecting the rightful
owner in possession of that which to produce requires
but manual labor and very little preparation, but it
gives no practical protection to the rightful owner in
securing to him even a part of the benefits of his production,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
if the same is the result of the labors of the
brain, after spending many years in hard and careful
study in making it possible for him to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Dame Justice with unsheathed sword stands guard
over the cellar of potatoes that took three months for
the ox and his owner to produce, but she is entirely
indifferent if an intelligent and educated engineer is
robbed of the results of his labors of several years, after
collecting a fee from him for doing that which it does
not do, and which it ought to do freely. It is manifestly
a peculiar logic, entirely at variance with the
rules, that govern the ideas of equity.</p>

<p>The man who produces a field of corn that will feed
a dozen cows is directly protected in the possession
thereof by the paid officers of the law of the community,
while the man who, by his exertions, lightens the burdens
of millions of human beings has no claim upon
the services of the community's enforcers of the law of
property rights.</p>

<p>It is confessedly an enigma to many a man, why
if an inventor is so unlucky as not to possess the large
sums of money required to engage the services of competent
attorneys, he must be content to see the despoiler
of the fruits of his labor enjoy it. And should
he, the inventor, be so indecorous as to accuse him of it,
the law will immediately fly to the assistance of his
despoiler, and clap the unlucky inventor in jail for libel.</p>

<p>Again, if a man, as member of a corporation, appropriates
another man's property the law does not permit
him to retain it, or exempt him from the consequences
of this unlawful action by reason of any limitation
of responsibility as a member of a corporation.
But, should the corporation appropriate another man's
invention, and after expensive and long drawn-out
litigations, the inventor should be awarded damages
from the company for exploiting his invention, all the
company has to do to avoid paying the award is to fail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>

and the same individuals can re-organize to do the same
business under a new charter and name, and may steal
the same inventor's patent again, providing it pays
it to do so, and the inventor would have to commence
to fight again in court.</p>

<p>To protect an invention is indeed a very serious
problem, under any and all circumstances, yet there
are certain conditions that will protect it in a measure.</p>

has the famed virtue of "covering a multitude of sins,"
but of keeping others from sinning against you.</p>

Second: Good and careful invention and designing
by making the mechanical contrivance as nearly basic
as the circumstances will permit, and to design and
invent contrivances for the same purpose in as many
other ways from the one to be used as possible, and
by patenting the same, making it harder for anybody
else to get around it.</p>

<p>Third: To so develop your means of producing
your invention, that they will enable you to hold your
own in competition in the market should it come.</p>

<p>Fourth: To have a good patent lawyer draw your
patent claims.</p>

<p>Fifth: If possible have that lawyer interested in
your invention.</p>

<p>Sixth: Never give it out to be worked on a royalty,
unless it is to some party with whose ability and
integrity you are satisfied, and even then have a clearly
defined contract in writing as to quantities and conditions.</p>

<p>Seventh: If the invention is assigned to a corporation,
do not leave yourself with a minority of stock if you can
at all help it, but if you cannot possibly avoid parting
with a majority of the stock, identify and amalgamate
your interests with some other stockholder in your
company, that in combination with him will give you
a majority and control; and arrange if possible for
your services to be indispensable and profitable to the
company.</p>

<p>Last, never sign an agreement with anybody assigning
to them all of your future improvements and inventions
you may make for the same purpose. You
will be reasonably protected if you can keep that "up
your sleeve." For the world is usually more mindful
of the man with the "Big Stick" than with the "Big
Grievance."</p>

<span class="smcap medium">Comparative Government Treatment&mdash;A Bounty
for Raising "Sugar Beets," but a
Tax on Inventions</span></a></h2>
</div>

<p>Laws are framed and a great deal of money spent
by our Government for the encouragement of useful
production by its people. For illustration, it is considered
that the best way to produce sugar, is the raising
of the sugar cane which is raised in the world in sufficient
quantities to meet all possible demands, and
naturally enough in places where it can be raised to the
best advantage. Many of those places are under the
Stars and Stripes, namely, Louisiana, Hawaii, Porto
Rico, and the Philippine Islands. Yet if a citizen who,
on his farm, could produce many diverse articles and
sell the same to advantage, chooses instead to raise
a vegetable (beets), from which sugar can be manufactured
at a disadvantage, expects and receives from
the Government not only absolute protection of his
production, and also the securing of an enhanced price
for the same, through a high tariff, but an actual bonus
of money known as a "bounty." But the inventor
who bestows great benefits on his fellow citizens and
the world at large, and gives it that which can not be
had at all elsewhere at the time, is evidently not deemed
by our law-makers of sufficient importance to receive
any encouragement or justice.</p>

<p>From what has been said here, it ought to be very
evident that there is a wide difference in the treatment
meted out by our Government to him who renders
services to society by digging in the dirt, and to him
who digs in the brain.</p>

<p>It is certainly good and just public policy that the
Government should spend a good deal of money for
the benefit of the farmers, but where is the justice and
the good public policy in making money out of the
inventors? (See statistics of the fiscal returns from
the Patent Office.) Is the former more indispensable
to society than the latter? Has not the ingenuity of
the inventor enabled even the farmer, the special protegé
of the Government, to get greater returns from
his labor than ever in the history of the world? Has
he not made his task lighter, and has he not enabled
him to get more of the good things of the world for the
earnings of his labor? And is it not in a great measure
through the inventor's ingenuity and industry that this
country has attained its unprecedented prosperity in
Peace and mighty potency in War?</p>

<p>Our formidable warships are always ready to race

the "moral" support of our "strong arm," in forcing
on the so-called heathens the barter of "cozy corners
in Heaven" for "cash down," but it is a notorious fact
that certain so-called civilized countries are making it
their habit and custom quite openly to appropriate
every invention that is worth appropriating, providing
the inventor is a foreigner, and the unfortunate inventor
has not even got a cause of action at law, nor
would the inventor's complaint at the State Department
be productive of anything more substantial than polite
regrets. These modern Barbary Pirates need not
fear another Commodore Perry, so long as they devote
their depredations solely to the comparatively more
valuable production of the brains instead of the hands.</p>

sufficiently to extend to them the encouragement

<p>One has indeed to be more than ordinarily gifted,
and most carefully trained in many directions, spiritual,
mental and physical, to be a successful inventor. To
improve by one's own ability and efforts the results of
any phase of human activities; to conceive, execute and
adopt and introduce a new and improved method for
the carrying out of certain human exertions without
infringing upon, or appropriating the efforts of others;
to secure a fair and just share of its benefits, to be
translated to higher planes of life, without becoming
over-conscious of it; to be called to the management
of affairs involving the interests, and welfare of others;
to be able to do so, not only profitably, but in a manner
to gain, hold and preserve the esteem of our fellow-beings,
is indeed a creditable achievement. Well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
worth the ambition of every high-minded person extraordinarily
gifted. It requires the proverbial wisdom
of an owl, the cunning of a fox, and the courage
and strength of a lion.</p>

<p>If the true history of all the pre-eminent inventors
should be written, it would be a record of "Making"
the most of oneself, painstaking labor, and of constant
devotion to duty, of as brave and as true men as ever
wore brass buttons and gold lace; who, without martial
glamour and loud acclaim, quietly solve and overcome
great difficulties, against discouraging odds, and attain
good results.</p>

<p>The world pays no heed to the efforts and struggles
of such men, often neglects to reward their good achievements,
yet it never fails to avail itself of their benefits.</p>

<p>The Monetary reward meted out by the world to
even the most successful inventors is insignificant, compared
to the benefits bestowed upon it by the beneficiary
of its gratitude.</p>

<p>The world is full of monuments and statues to them
who have or have tried to benefit it by destruction
and slaughter, and by the making of widows and
orphans, but one would have to use "Diogenes' Candle,"
to find the monuments to them who have benefited
the world, by giving it untold wealth and happiness,
without sorrow or suffering, except to themselves,
through scientific and mechanical research and invention.</p>

<p>The feeling of having benefited our fellows, of having
helped to improve the world for others, as others
have done for us, the sweet consciousness of having
given the world "What was best in us," is the true and
only adequate reward to him who has given his best
efforts to lighten human burdens and increase their
